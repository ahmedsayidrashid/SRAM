SRAM Interfacing with Raspberry Pi Pico.

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates how to interface SRAM (Static RAM) with the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. It includes wiring schematics, Python code for communication, and PS/2 pinout diagrams.

Key Features:
        Communicates with TC5565APL SRAM using GPIO pins.
        Implements read and write operations to SRAM.
        Uses PS/2 interface for keyboard input.
Usage:
        git clone https://github.com/ahmedsayidrashid/SRAM.git
        Follow the pinout diagrams for wiring connections.
        Run the Interface.py script to interact with the SRAM.
